## SCHOLA

### Creating a world where learning is:

- Accessible to all.
- Motivating and rewarding.
- A catalyst for personal and professional development.

### Mission

- Our mission is to revolutionize the learning experience to create incentivized learning platforms
- We strive to empower individuals and organizations, transforming personal and professional
- development into a rewarding journey.

### Vision

- Every person has access to personalized and motivating learning opportunities.
- Continuous learning is an open door to endless possibilities.

### Problem

- The completion rate of online courses does not exceed 15%.
- **Challenge:** keeping students and employees engaged and motivated.

### Solution

- Framework for creating online learning experiences with Web 3 pillars:
- **Verifiable Examination:** Verify your knowledge with Proof of Learning (PoL).
- **LLM-Mediated:** 24/7 tutor to delve deeper into topics.
- P**ortable Certificates:** Demonstrate your knowledge independently of the employer.
- **Extractable Economic** Value: Option to redeem your rewards in cash.

Flexibility for content developers to decide whether rewards will be cash, certificates, or both.

### Case of use

**Users can create or join learning challenges.**

A group of friends challenge each other to learn a new topic over a week. To show their commitment, each participant can enter with a deposit. At the end of the challenge, those who have performed best or made the most progress will receive greater benefits from their initial investment, thus incentivizing active participation and effort.

This unique feature allows Scola to stand out in the "Learn to Earn" market, fostering not only individual learning but also the creation of a learning community where joint effort is directly rewarded.
