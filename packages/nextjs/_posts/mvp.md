# Trivia proposal implemented on VARA network

### Overview:

We developed a smart contract on the VARA network to create and manage interactive trivia games on the blockchain. Users can create trivia games with questions, correct answers, and predetermined prizes. Players participate by answering the questions, and if they answer correctly, they receive the prize.

### Advantages using VARA

- **Transparency and Security:** VARA, based on blockchain, guarantees the transparency of the trivia games. Questions, correct answers, and prizes are recorded immutably, preventing manipulation and ensuring fair play.
- **Decentralization:** Being on the blockchain, the trivia game does not depend on a central server, reducing the risk of downtime and ensuring constant availability.
- **Automated Payments:** Prize payments are made automatically through smart contracts, eliminating intermediaries and guaranteeing fast and secure payments to winners.
- **Inter-Contract Interaction:** The trivia game can interact with other contracts on VARA, opening up possibilities for integration with tokens, NFTs, or other games.
- **Active Community:** VARA has an active community of developers and users, which can drive the adoption and popularity of the trivia game.

### **Technical Implementation**

- **Factory Contract:** The main contract, "Factory," allows users to create instances of trivia games. When creating a trivia game, the questions, correct answers, and prize are defined.
- **Data Storage:** Trivia games are stored in the contract's state, including questions, answers, and prize details.
- **Player Participation:** Players interact with trivia instances by sending messages with their answers. The contract verifies the answers and, if correct, automatically sends the prize to the player.

### Benefits for Users

- **Reliable Gaming Experience:** Players can trust the integrity of the game thanks to the transparency and security of the blockchain.
- **Guaranteed Prizes:** Prizes are delivered automatically, without delays or risk of non-payment.
- **Integration Opportunities:** The possibility of integrating trivia with other elements of VARA offers a richer and more engaging experience.

### Monetization

- **Creation Fees:** A small fee can be charged to users for creating trivia games.
- **Prize Participation:** The contract could retain a percentage of the prizes as revenue.
- **Advertising:** Ads can be displayed in the trivia interface to generate additional income.

### Additional Considerations

- **Scalability:** It is important to design the contract to handle a large number of trivia games and players.
- **User Experience:** The trivia interface should be intuitive and easy to use to attract a wide audience.
- **Marketing:** Promoting the trivia game in the VARA community and on social media is key to its success.

### Conclusion

- Developing a trivia game on the VARA network offers an exciting opportunity to create a transparent, secure, and engaging gaming experience. By leveraging the advantages of blockchain technology, this trivia game can stand out in the market and generate benefits for both users and creators.
